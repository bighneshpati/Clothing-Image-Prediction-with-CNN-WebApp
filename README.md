### Clothing-Image-Prediction-with-CNN-WebApp explains how to build Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for Fashion MNIST project which is an Image Recognition Clothing Prediction Web App which we are going to build using Convolutional Neural Network and Flask App. This is a complete project tutorial series where we are going to learn how to train the CNN model on Fashion MNIST greyscale Image dataset and build a corresponding Flask based web app to show the Image predictions in terms of Fashion Tags.
